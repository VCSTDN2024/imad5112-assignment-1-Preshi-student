About the Project
The Suggestions app is a project that we had to do as part of our IMAD
assignment. To create an app that displays suggestions when the user
types in the time of day to have the meal either breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
This app was created using the coding language known as Kotlin and it
was created within Android Studio.
Design Considerations of the App
The app was designed within the layout view of Android studio.
 It has a textView which displays the name which is, “Preshi’s Meals.”
 It has an EditText whereby I as the developer asks the user to type
in a particular day of time in which they will get suggestions based
on the particular time whether breakfast, lunch, or dinner they type
in.
 It has two buttons the Suggestions button and the Reset button.
 After typing in the time of day, the suggestions button is what the
user clicks on to view the different suggestions put out before them.
 The Reset button is what loads everything all over incase the user
would like to view all the options before making a final choice on
what to type in.
 Also, the image background is a simple collage of some of different
foods ranging from breakfast, lunch, and dinner whereby before the
user opens the app, their attention is already drawn to what the app
could be about.
The app’s design is quite simple and straightforward no complexity that
the user can easily navigate where they want to go on the app without any
difficulties. It is quite user friendly.

Github
The app’s codes were continuously pushed through github each time I
made changes to the app, added more features perhaps colour and
images then I would commit and push these changes to github. By
pushing to github I kept track of the changes that were being made.
